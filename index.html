                                            Swami Maharaj, is a denomination of the Swaminarayan branch of Hinduism. It
                                            consists of a 11,500-square-foot (1,070 m2), 73-foot (22 m) tall open-air
                                            temple and a 25,620-square-foot (2,380 m2) surrounding deck. By July 2004
                                            the cost to build the temple was $7 million at that time. The temple
                                            materials were carved out of Italian marble and Turkish limestone by 3,000
                                            craftsmen in various parts of India. The pieces were shipped to Houston, and
                                            construction began in March 2002. 175 volunteers, including some individuals
                                            resident in India, came to the Houston area to help build the temple. Most
                                            of the labor was donated. Up until the opening, some finishing touches to
                                            the structure were made.[3] The marble and limestone add up to 33,000
                                            pieces. The mandir was built in 28 months.[citation needed]

                                            situated in the Puri district of Odisha. This marvel of architecture is
                                            dedicated to Indian God of Sun, Surya. The temple has been built in the
                                            shape of his chariot which is drawn by seven horses.

                                            The temple was built in the 13th century by a king called Narasimhadeva.
                                            There is an ancient legend attached to this temple, once Lord Krishna cursed
                                            one of his own sons with leprosy. To seek penance, his son, Samba worshiped
                                            Surya for twelve years.

                                            Pleased with his devotion, Surya healed him. Samba made the Sun temple in
                                            return to express his gratitude. The mesmerizing beauty of the place was
                                            best summed up by Rabindranath Tagore: ‘Here the language of stone surpasses
                                            the language of man.’</span>

                                            all had people in our lives who didnt make it this far. Disease or accident
                                            claimed their lives early. My oldest brother was killed in a car accident.
                                            He will be forever twenty. Old age is a gift.I care a lot less about what I
                                            wear and how I look. Oh, I still take care
                                            of myself. But, my wardrobe consists mainly of t-shirts, jeans and comfy
                                            shoes or sandals. When I worked, along with business attire, I put on full
                                            makeup every day, styled my hair. Now, I throw on some mascara and blush if
                                            Im going out, pull my hair back into a ponytail and off I go. And, I let my
                                            hair go grey. Twenty years ago grey hair and wrinkles bothered me _ no more.
                                            Im free!Along with the confidence to sport grey hair and wrinkles, aging
                                            has
